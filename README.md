Does it take too long to choose the right pizza when you stay at a pizzeria?
Need to read all the ingredients before customizing your pizzas to your liking?
This takes too long and is very tedious.
That is why this application was created, which aims to speed up the choice of pizza by choosing the right ingredients that you like.
(I am still working on completing the application)
